# Vuidget -  Vue.js embaddable widget
### Supporting Vue-Router and Vuex!

In case you're wondering how to create a full-functioning Vue.js *(routes, actions, state management..)* embeddable widget in HTML, check this repository - the source and the commits.

The result are going to be bundled .js and .css files, that allow you to embed your widget as an HTML component -
`<my-widget title="My beautiful widget">`

Of course, if you're using custom fonts or images, those are also going to be generated while you build the source.

**This Vue.js application was created on 22.07.2018 with Vue CLI 3. That means any config I might have is inherited from @vue/cli. Any required dependencies to allow this app to function as an embeddable widget will be listed below.**

...

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```

```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
